3) Execute the [project] command "release-keystore.bat" or "release-keystore.sh" or "release-keystore-macos.sh" to get the "appcompatrecyclerviewdemo1-release.keystore"
            warning: the file "appcompatrecyclerviewdemo1-release.keystore" should be created only once [per application] otherwise it will fail!
 

4 [Gradle]: execute the [project] command "gradle-local-apksigner.bat" [or .sh] to get the [release] signed Apk! (thanks to TR3E!)
            hint: look for [project] folder "...\build\outputs\apk\release"
 

4 [Ant]: execute the [project] command "ant-build-release.bat" [.sh] to get the [release] signed Apk!"
         hint: look for [project] folder "...\bin"
